Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed from the array, all
the other element are shifted in memory.But, Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a 
doubly Linked list, so no shifting of all the element required.


Arraylist is better for storing and accessing data, as it takes less time than Linked list. Because in Linked List to 
access and store data the timr complexity will be O(N) in worst case where as for arrayList it take O(1).
