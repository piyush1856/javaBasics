Q.What is the difference between the static and the non-static variables of a class explain it with an example.

  //static variable //                             // non static variable//

1.static belongs to class.                   1.non-static belongs to object.

2. static variables we can access by         2.we can not access non-static variables
class name.                                    with class name.
example: ClassName.staticVariableName

3.Same copy is shared among all objects      3.non-static variables having their own copy.
 of class as it is a static variable

4.Static variable initializes with           4.Non-static variable initializes with
default values at the time of class            default values at the time of object
loading/ during compilation.                   creation/during runtime.(new operator)

5.example: In ATM welcome screen needs       5.Example: while account number,phone number
to show for all users hence its variable       is different for different user hence they
declaration is in static                       are declared as non-static.
