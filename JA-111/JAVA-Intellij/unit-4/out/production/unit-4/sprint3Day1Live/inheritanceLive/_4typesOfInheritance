1. Single/simple Inheritance : Father -> Son
2. Multilevel Inheritance : Father -> Son -> Grandson
3. Hierarchical Inheritance : Pet -> cat&dog
4. Multiple Inheritance : Dog&Cat -> Pet (not supported in java)
        here pet will get confused either bark or meow because pet is derived
        from both cat and dog. In c++ it is supported.
5. Hybrid Inheritance : A -> B&C -> D
        combination of both Hierarchical and multiple inheritance.
        This is also called diamond inheritance.
