We cannot refer to a specific member of child class in case if parent class referance and child class object
so, we need to downcast the object to child class and hence, we achieve object down-casting.

this is only possible with the super class reference and child class object.

We can downcast the parent class variable to the child class object only if the Parent class variable
points to the child class object, otherwise it will throw a runtime exception


please refer to example file for further explanation
