The significance of using final keyword with the following programming constructirss are as follows:

 1. Variable : In case the final keyword is applied to a variable, its value cannot be changed once initialized.
                eg: final int variable =10;
                In the above example the value of variable will remain 10 throughout the program.

 2. Method : In case the final keyword is applied to a method, the method cannot be Overridden. It is just opposite of overriding.
             eg: final void finalMethod(){}
             In the above example the method cannot be overridden by the child class because of final keyword.

 3. class :  In case the final keyword is applied to a class, the class cannot be extended further.
                          eg: final void finalClass{}
                          In the above example the class cannot be extended to the child class because of final keyword.
