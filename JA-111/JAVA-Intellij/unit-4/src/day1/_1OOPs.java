    //Programming styles: OOPs , functional programming, Procedural, Hybrid
    /*
    * OOP: Car(Wheels, GB, Engine) (start(), stop()) --> JAVA - everything can be represented in form of objects
    * since primitives(int, float) are not object so wrapper classes are introduced.
    *Eg: Java, C#, C++, Scala
    *
    *
    * functional programming : these are function based programming language when we create function and call
    * here and there. eg : JavaScript, After Java version 8 : Lambda, Streams
    * therefore java is both oops and functional
    *
    *
    * Hybrid : Java, Scala -- because they support more than one programming style
    *
    *
    * Procedural : which have been used historically to solve computer problem. Low level languages
    *               (not much in use) eg C, COBOL, Fotron
    * */
